## Machine Learning in Music ##
This research theme studies the various applications of machine learning in music. It encompasses topics like how to transform the format of digital music, for example, from MIDI to audio,or from audio to MIDI or sheet music; how to generate music with diverse control, how to build an interactive-AI system for music production.

## Machine Learning for Content Generation ##
We are interested in machine learning algorithms and systems for content generation. The current topics including how to add new control to a pretrained AIGC model, and how to more effectively learn a AIGC model for contents beyond image, vision and text. At methodology level, this theme share some similar insights from the theme "Low-supervision Learning via Knowledge Transfer from Pretrained Models"

## Low-supervision Learning via Knowledge Transfer from Pretrained Models
This research theme investigates methods that can use a small amount of supervision to build a machine learning system. In particular, we are interested in transferring knowledge learned from a pre-trained model to achieve this goal. At the application level, this project encompasses a wide range of applications, examples including image or text classification, dense prediction such as semantic or instance segmentation, information extraction in NLP, content generation, etc.

## Life-long Maintenance for Machine Learning systems 
Building a real-world machine learning system can be more complicated than a one-shot training process. Continual learning and adaptation in the deploying environment, monitoring, and correcting system error could also be essential features that an ideal machine learning system should have. In this theme, we will explore various techniques to perform life-long maintenance for machine learning systems, including continual learning, source-free adaptation, model editing, etc.

## Generalisable Machine Learning Systems
The goal of this research theme is to build machine learning systems that are generalizable across different test environments and tasks. This encompasses domain generalization, cross-task generalization, and compositional generalization.

##  Rationale-guided Machine Learning
The most machine learning system is based on the principle of Empirical Risk Minimization. Any features and classifiers that contribute to risk minimization will be acquired from the learning process. In this research theme, we consider ``prediction rationale'' -- clues about why a certain decision is made in the learning process. We are investigating how to represent rationale and how to put forward various regularizations on the rationale clues. This is expected to lead to more generalizable or more data-efficient machine learning systems.
