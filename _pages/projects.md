## Low-supervision Learning via Knowledge Transfer from Pretrained Models
This research project investigates methods that can use a small amount of supervision to build a machine learning system. In particular, we are interested in transfering knowledge learned from a pretrained model to achieve this goal. At the application level, this project encompasses a wide range of applications, examples including image or text classification, dense prediction such as semantic or instance segmentation, information extraction in NLP, content generation etc.


## Life-long Maintenance for Machine Learning systems 
Building a machine learning system can be more complicated than a one-shot training. Continual learning and adaptation in the deploying environment, monitoring and providing feedback of system failure could also be important features that an ideal machine learning system should have. In this project, we will explore various techniques to perform life-long maintenance for machine learning systems.
