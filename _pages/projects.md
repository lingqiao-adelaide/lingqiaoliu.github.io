## Low-supervision Learning via Knowledge Transfer from Pretrained Models
This research theme investigates methods that can use a small amount of supervision to build a machine learning system. In particular, we are interested in transfering knowledge learned from a pretrained model to achieve this goal. At the application level, this project encompasses a wide range of applications, examples including image or text classification, dense prediction such as semantic or instance segmentation, information extraction in NLP, content generation etc.

## Life-long Maintenance for Machine Learning systems 
Building a machine learning system can be more complicated than a one-shot training process. Continual learning and adaptation in the deploying environment, monitoring and providing feedback of system failure could also be important features that an ideal machine learning system should have. In this theme, we will explore various techniques to perform life-long maintenance for machine learning systems, including continual learning, source-free adaptation, model editing etc.

## Generalisable Machine Learning Systems
The goal of this research theme is to build machine learning systems that are generalisable across different test environment and tasks.This encompasses domain generalization, cross-task generalization, and compositional generalization.
