## Low-supervision Learning via Knowledge Transfer from Pretrained Models
This research project investigates methods that can use a small amount of supervision to build a machine learning system. In particular, we are interested in transfering knowledge learned from a pretrained model to achieve this goal. At the application level, this project encompasses a wide range of applications, examples including image or text classification, dense prediction, information extraction in NLP, content generation etc.
